# Yagisans_AToF_GameSettings

This file contains a lot of small changes that change the feel of Skyrim. Overall loot is reduced, and made more logical.

There is much less gold available as loot, and death items are more logical.

Each of the nine holds and Solstheim will offer a themed set of items, including foods and drink for their regions, including DLC items where appropriate.

# Leveled List Changes

## Animals and Creatures

Death items from animals and creatures is more believable. For example animals no longer drop treasure.

## NPC Enemies

Enemies have much less gold and valuables.

## Quest Rewards

Quest rewards now award you with the best version of a leveled item. For example, if you have become a Nightingale, there is no reason to award you an inferior version of those rewards. This includes the Soul Cairn keepers dropping their Dragonbone equipment (this would originally only drop if you waited until after level 45 to ever visit it).

# Quest Changes

## Hearthfire Home Attacks

All hearthfire home attacks have been disabled.

## Hearthfire Lumber Purchase.

You no longer need to own a hearthfire home to purchase lumber. This is useful for mod added homes that need lumber.

## Northwind Quarry

Northing Quarry is no longer flagged as a location suitable for hunting dragons. This prevents hunt the dragon quests there while the House/Quarry mod is installed.
