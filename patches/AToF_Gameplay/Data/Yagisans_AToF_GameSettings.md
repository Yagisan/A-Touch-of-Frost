# Yagisans_AToF_GameSettings

This file contains a lot of small changes that change the feel of Skyrim. Overall loot is reduced, and made more logical.

There is much less gold available as loot, and death items are more logical.

Each of the nine holds and Solstheim will offer a themed set of items, including foods and drink for their regions, including DLC items where appropriate.

# Leveled List Changes

## Animals and Creatures

Death items from animals and creatures is more believable. For example animals no longer drop treasure.

## NPC Enemies

Enemies have much less gold and valuables.

## Quest Rewards

Quest rewards now award you with the best version of a leveled item. For example, if you have become a Nightingale, there is no reason to award you an inferior version of those rewards.
